ToDo:
@ create-repo.sh shouldn't run w/o params at all!
@ MD5 file per pkg
* Dash compliant
* external TXT pkg desc
* watch the proces somehow
* modify installation menu(s) to support additional categories and added packages
* tfn configs for things like httpd, web sites, etc.
* all configs in pkgs must end with .new !
* re-do httpd to enabled-sites or alike (like in Debian ... oh silicon lord!)
* solve "deps" by txt file (GBS alike)
* kernel - after an installation, notify user to update his/her LiLO
* move versioning to profiles, because it's quite retarded to change trilion
files eg. due to kernel version change; and i think it also would be cool to
be able to compile older versions eg. kernel 2.6.32.21 without re-editing
everything *again* like a chimp. ;;; 
say: "k/kernel-huge;2.6.32.21;x64_64;" could do?
* generated filelist output is un-ordered :(
* loop-AES for -v4l by appending -v4l to Kversion
* locking in /tmp/.slackbuilder.lock or wherever
* create an auto conf .$1 -> .$1.new + doinst.sh substr
X auto arch detection ~ dismissed
* one could write a crawler that would sweep repo and create filelist/checksums 
by himself instead of tedious regeneration of these lists
* a nice to have would be restart from failed PKG, not from the point #1
* speed up re-generation, especially MD5-sums
* ISO is going to carry tag files along
* an ISO is missing dist pkgs !!!
